  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I'm a Massachusetts native currently living in the Greater Seattle Area working as a software engineer at Amazon. I've worked on a variety of projects and products including Amazon Fresh fulfillment, the ordering pipeline and Prime Now fulfillment. More recently, I switched over to the Amazon Web Services Marketplace team.</p>
  <p>Outside of work I enjoy being outdoors, listening to music and playing guitar.</p>
  <h2>Yeah, so what's this about?</h2>
  <p>This website is (hopefully) going to be a place that holds my pieces of work; whether that's my writing, music, code, videos and whatever else I get around to doing. I have a large <a href="bucketlist.html">bucketlist</a> of items that I'd like to someday get to. Here's hoping this website is the beginning of that! Stay tuned...</p>
